# Data & Social Justice

Bennington College, Fall 2018  
[Dan Phiffer](https://phiffer.org/) [danphiffer@bennington.edu](mailto:danphiffer@bennington.edu)  
Time: Monday/Wednesday 6:30-8:20  
Course Number: DA 2135.01, 4 credits

## Course Description

Digital technologies have fundamentally shifted how social justice movements operate. “Organizing without organizations” and “laptop activism” are no longer novel or fringe activities. The social media tools we rely on to gather in public can also be antagonistic toward individual participants. This course explores the digital tools and data archives that inform modern political engagement. We will discuss existing precedents, prototype new software tools, and study our own social media archives to identify risks and possibilities.

## Expectations and Requirements

* Class attendance and punctuality
* Participation during class discussions and presentations
* Weekly assignments + accompanying blog posts
* Midterm and final project + online documentation

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you have an academic accommodation.

All students are allowed a maximum of two absences. It is worth stressing that because the class covers so much new material, it is very much to your advantage to not miss any classes, if possible.

## Evaluation

Final evaluation will be based on the completion of all assignments, blog posts, class participation, quality of work, and attendance.

For homework assignments, it is more important that you put forth effort and attempts to understand and experiment with the material than it is for you to create a 100% successful project (particularly for first-time coders). Everyone gets one free pass for turning in an assignment late, but *only one*.

For the midterm and final projects, I am more interested in what you choose to do than in what you *can do*. We will elaborate on these distinctions in class.

## Format

The course will cover a number of different themes that intersect with issues of technology, data, political engagement, and social justice. The first half of the course is concerned with the world wide web, and the second half of the course focuses on working with data.

There is a consistent pattern to the course schedule: first we discuss readings and assignments, then we'll do a technical tutorial, followed by a video or case study. I will screen-record the technical sections of class so that you can refer to them outside of class.

Though we will meet in a lab that has computers, some of you will need to bring your laptop with you to class, as we have more students enrolled than we do workstations.

I can be reached via email at all times, but I am very slow to respond to emails sent over the weekend. If you are in need of a prompt response, please email during the week. I reserve 24 hours to respond, but typically will reply much sooner.

## Materials

All readings are either available from public websites or (if not) will be shared with students digitally. Please bring a USB thumb drive with you to each class. I will provide thumb drives for purchase for those of you who need one.

## Acknowledgments

This syllabus borrows from a variety of other syllabi and the generous suggestions of friends and comrades.
